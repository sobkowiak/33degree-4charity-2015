# Testing the interfaces

. To test the file processing, there are existing files in the `order-service-file` module

  cp dev/order-service-file/src/test/resources/data/message1.xml $SMX_HOME/target/placeorder/
  cp dev/order-service-file/src/test/resources/data/message2.csv $SMX_HOME/target/placeorder/
+
To see what happened look at the log file, either from the console

 log:tail
+
or from the command line (ServiceMix):

  tail -f data/log/servicemix.log
+
(or Karaf):

  tail -f data/log/karaf.log
  
. To test the SOAP, use your favorite WS tool (e.g. SoapUI) against the following WSDL `http://localhost:8989/soap/order?wsdl` hosted by the `order-service-soap` bundle. You can use the sample request from link:../dev/order-service-soap/src/test/resources/data[`dev/order-service-soap/src/test/resources/data`]
. To test the REST, use your favorite WS tool (e.g. SoapUI) against the following WADL `http://localhost:8989/rest/?_wadl` hosted by the `order-service-rest` bundle. You can use the sample request from link:../dev/order-service-rest/src/test/resources/data[`dev/order-service-rest/src/test/resources/data`]
