# Building & running the custom distribution

Instead of installing the features on link:servicemix.adoc[Apache ServiceMix] or link:karaf.adoc[Apache Karaf] you can use the link:../ops/order-service-full-runtime[full custom distribution] which includes all features preinstalled.

The distribution is built automatically while building the demo.

. Build this project to deploy the bundles into your local maven repo

  mvn clean install

. Go to `ops/order-service-full-runtime/target` and unpack the distribution assembly according to the operating system you use

  cd ops/order-service-full-runtime/target
  tar xvf *.tgz

. Start Karaf

  order-service-full-runtime-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/karaf

. link:testing-interfaces.adoc[Test the interfaces]
