# Building & running the demo on Apache ServiceMix

To run this demo on Apache ServiceMix you must perform following steps:

. Build this project to deploy the bundles into your local maven repo

  mvn clean install

. Start ServiceMix

  $SMX_HOME/bin/servicemix

. Add this projects features.xml config to ServiceMix from the Console (makes it easier to install bundles with all required dependencies) 

  feature:repo-add mvn:org.sobkowiak.demos/order-service-feature/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features

. Install the project
  
  feature:install order-service-common 
  feature:install order-service-backend 
  feature:install order-service-normalizer 
  feature:install order-service-file 
  feature:install order-service-rest 
  feature:install order-service-soap 

. To test the file processing, there are existing files in the `order-service-file` module

  cp dev/order-service-file/src/test/resources/data/message1.xml $SMX_HOME/target/placeorder/
  cp dev/order-service-file/src/test/resources/data/message2.csv $SMX_HOME/target/placeorder/
+
To see what happened look at the log file, either from the console

 log:tail
+
or from the command line

  tail -f data/log/servicemix.log
  
. To test the SOAP, use your favorite WS tool (e.g. SoapUI) against the following WSDL http://localhost:8989/soap/order?wsdl hosted by the `order-service-soap` bundle. You can use the sample request from link:../dev/order-service-soap/src/test/resources/data[`dev/order-service-soap/src/test/resources/data`]
. To test the REST, use your favorite WS tool (e.g. SoapUI) against the following WADL http://localhost:8989/rest/?_wadl hosted by the `order-service-rest` bundle. You can use the sample request from link:../dev/order-service-rest/src/test/resources/data[`dev/order-service-rest/src/test/resources/data`]
