# Building & running the demo on Apache Karaf

This demo works on Apache Karaf similar to the demo on Apache ServiceMix, but you must prepare Karaf before you install the demo bundles. You must perform following steps:

. Build this project to deploy the bundles into your local maven repo

  mvn clean install

. Start Karaf

  $KARAF_HOME/bin/karaf

. Install Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ features on Karaf

  feature:repo-add camel 2.16.1
  feature:install camel-blueprint camel-cxf camel-jms camel-bindy camel-jaxb
  feature:repo-add activemq 5.12.1
  feature:install activemq-broker activemq-camel activemq-blueprint
  
. Add this projects features.xml config to ServiceMix from the Console (makes it easier to install bundles with all required dependencies) 

  feature:repo-add mvn:org.sobkowiak.demos/order-service-feature/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features

. Install the project
  
  feature:install order-service-common 
  feature:install order-service-backend 
  feature:install order-service-normalizer 
  feature:install order-service-file 
  feature:install order-service-rest 
  feature:install order-service-soap 

. To test the file processing, there are existing files in the `order-service-file` module

  cp dev/order-service-file/src/test/resources/data/message1.xml $SMX_HOME/target/placeorder/
  cp dev/order-service-file/src/test/resources/data/message2.csv $SMX_HOME/target/placeorder/
+
To see what happened look at the log file, either from the console

 log:tail
+
or from the command line

  tail -f data/log/karaf.log
  
. To test the SOAP, use your favorite WS tool (e.g. SoapUI) against the following WSDL http://localhost:8989/soap/order?wsdl hosted by the `order-service-soap` bundle. You can use the sample request from link:../dev/order-service-soap/src/test/resources/data[`dev/order-service-soap/src/test/resources/data`]
. To test the REST, use your favorite WS tool (e.g. SoapUI) against the following WADL http://localhost:8989/rest/?_wadl hosted by the `order-service-rest` bundle. You can use the sample request from link:../dev/order-service-rest/src/test/resources/data[`dev/order-service-rest/src/test/resources/data`]
